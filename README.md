# pietInterpreter

To run:

    In a terminal/command prompt navigate to the directory pietInterpreter.java is in
  
    Run the interpreter with a .ppm file with "java Interpreter filename.ppm"

This is an interpreter for the esoteric programming language Piet.

Keep in mind that I did not write any of the .ppm files included in this directory.
Instead I used the examples from a variety of sources for testing.
I don't personally know if these are all perfectly written, I've just been using these as a base to test my program.

Just a fun project I've been wanting to work on for a little while now.

The Piet syntax, commands, etc. are all described at http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html
