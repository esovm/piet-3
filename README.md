# pietInterpreter

To run:
  In a terminal/command prompt navigate to the directory pietInterpreter.java is in
  Run the interpreter with a .ppm file with "java Interpreter filename.ppm"

This is an interpreter for the esoteric programming language Piet.

Just a fun project I've been wanting to work on for a little while now.

The Piet syntax, commands, etc. are all described at http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html
