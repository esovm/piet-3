Here's the things I want to do with this project:
  Incorporate into a webapp (JAX-RS API)
    Users could:
      Follow the stack trace of a piet program
      Give input that would turn into a piet program
        Users could constantly regenerate different random programs that would output that input
  Allow any photo type, jpg, png, etc, not just .ppm
  Use gradle well
  Unit tests
